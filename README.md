Employing natural language processing and machine learning techniques to compare three different navigation applications (Google Maps, Waze, and HERE WeGo) based on user reviews 

This paper aims to compare three different navigation applications (Google Maps, Waze, and HERE WeGo) based on reviews collected in 2017 and 2018 
from 140 different countries. In this paper, we discuss the subject of topic modeling, which provides the methods to organize, understand, 
and summarize large collections of textual information. Specifically, we studied the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique 
and the effect of LDA when choosing a different number of topics and a different dictionary of words. 
Through this analysis we were able to identify key customer review topics and insights that HERE WeGo may find valuable.
